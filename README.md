# sql-rostering-project

In order to simulate a course management database with many-to-many relationship, I have normalized the following data:

    Sonny, si106, Instructor
    Adil, si106, Learner
    Anousha, si106, Learner
    Coban, si106, Learner
    Tahlia, si106, Learner
    Yutong, si110, Instructor
    Anmolpreet, si110, Learner
    Data, si110, Learner
    Keela, si110, Learner
    Rubii, si110, Learner
    Hijab, si206, Instructor
    Eljay, si206, Learner
    Glascott, si206, Learner
    Kayleb, si206, Learner
    Kyron, si206, Learner







Then , I have inserted the following data items into the database, creating and linking all the foreign keys properly. I have encoded instructor with a role of 1 and a learner with a role of 0.
